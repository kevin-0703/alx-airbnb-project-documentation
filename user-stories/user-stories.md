# Airbnb Clone – User Stories

These user stories are derived from the use case diagram created in Task 1.  
They capture the interactions of different actors with the system and the value they gain.

   - As a **guest**, I want to **book a property online** so that I can secure my stay in advance.

4. **Payment**

   - As a **guest**, I want to **make secure payments for my bookings** so that I can confirm my reservation without issues.

  **“As a [actor], I want to [action] so that [benefit].”**
- These stories will form the foundation for backlog items in agile development.
